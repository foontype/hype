Build and deploy (task build + helmfile apply)

This command first runs the build task (if available) and then
applies the helmfile configuration to deploy your application.

Examples:
  hype my-nginx up                   Build and deploy my-nginx
EOF
}

help_up_brief() {
    echo "Build and deploy (task build + helmfile apply)"
}

help_down() {
    cat <<EOF
Usage: hype <hype-name> down

Destroy deployment (helmfile destroy)

This command destroys the deployment by running helmfile destroy,
removing all resources created by the helmfile.

Examples:
  hype my-nginx down                 Destroy my-nginx deployment
EOF
}

help_down_brief() {
    echo "Destroy deployment (helmfile destroy)"
}

help_restart() {
    cat <<EOF
Usage: hype <hype-name> restart

Restart deployment (down + up)

This command performs a complete restart by first destroying
the current deployment and then rebuilding and redeploying.

Examples:
  hype my-nginx restart              Restart my-nginx deployment
EOF
}

help_restart_brief() {
    echo "Restart deployment (down + up)"
}
